# Recreating Hans Rosling's Visualizations in Python
This project aims to recreate dynamic visualizations similar to Hans Rosling's presentations using Python. The project utilizes various libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Choropleth for data analysis and visualization.

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts and notebooks that demonstrate the process of recreating Hans Rosling's data visualizations. The project is divided into the following sections:

Data Preprocessing:  Details about preparing the datasets used for analysis.
Analysis and Visualization:  Description of the analysis performed using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Choropleth, along with visualizations created.

## Datasets
our datasets were utilized for the analysis:

Dataset 1: Life_Expectancy.csv
Dataset 2: fertility_rate.csv
Dataset 3: Country_population.csv
Dataset 4: metadata_Country.csv

## Tools and Libraries
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly
Choropleth

## Usage
### Prerequisite
Python 
Installation of the above required libraries 

## Examples of Visualizations
Animated scatter plots using Matplotlib
Interactive plots using Plotly
Choropleth maps showcasing global data

## TED Talk Reference
The project was inspired by [Hans Rosling's TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen)
 aiming to emulate his data storytelling and visualization techniques.
